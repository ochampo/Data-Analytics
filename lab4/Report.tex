\section{Question 8}

According to the article, "Has Autism Prevalence Increased? " it state that the increasing number of autsim has increased because the definition of autsim has become broader. Therefore more people can be claimed austisic. It is very hard to say that as the vaccines have been presnt there has been more signs of austim. we cannot compare them just yet because we should also note that austsim, has had it defintion changed during 1994, when asperger's was included in the defeniton 23 years ago. I really could not find good data for austim. So I just went off the data that was used in research papers.

\section{Question 9}

The data set  I used was polio, I looked up the polio vacine was available in 1968 in the united states, since that time, we steatly got rid of polio altogeher. 




\section{Question 10}

In the article Law, Ethics, and Public Health in the Vaccination Debates: Politics of the Measles Outbreak‚Äù I can say that it is usually ethical for people to allow to be opted out from Vaccines, but the draw back to this is that it affects other people in the process. Although The argument maybe said that if everyone around is vaccinated what is the point? The brings in the problem because many people may have the same mentality and therefore they are not better off, the only way everyone is better off is if everyone is vaccinated. There should be only be privilege to a person to opt out if the medication more harm than good, in certain cause maybe a child maybe allergic to the medication. There is no inequality i can think that can cause such an up roar.
